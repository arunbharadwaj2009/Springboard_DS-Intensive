    "The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37$^{\\circ}$C or 98.6$^{\\circ}$F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?"

The mean, median and mode of body temperatures are 98.249, 98.3 and 98.0 respectively. Given the small sample set (130 samples), it can be said that inspite of the mode not being equal to the mean and median, this data is still normal. Scipy package normal test gives a p-value of 0.25.

With the smaller sample, the t-test gives p-value of 0.0058. While the null hypothesis can still be rejected at 0.05 significance level, the p-value of the 10 observation sample is substantially larger than the p-value of the 130 observation sample.

    "6) By splitting the data based on gender, we can now test whether there is a significant difference in body temperatures between men and women. For this, we perform the 2 sample t-test since we are now trying to compare the population means of the 2 samples and we still do not know the population standard deviation. The 2 sample t-test null hypothesis states that the 2 samples have identical true population means. The high p-value supports this null hypothesis."

While it is possible that sampling was done incorrectly, the current sample rejects this notion. 3) Finally, based on the sample data, we conclude that there is no significant difference in the population means of body temperatures of men and women."
